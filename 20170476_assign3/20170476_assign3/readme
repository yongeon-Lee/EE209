[EE209] Assignment 3: Customer Management Table

Name : Yongeon Lee
Student ID : 20170476

1.No help from others except TA

2.Compare the implementation of customer_manager using array and the one using hash table respectively.
Please try to provide reasonable explanation for the pros and cons of each implementaion.
A: Using Array is slower than Using hash table when the user increases. 
   Using Array requires lots of time when searching specific user. To find the empty space for save information,
   we have to check whether it is empty or not from the first array elements. By user increases, the amount of time to find empty space
   will also increase dramatically.
   However, when we use Hash Table, we can search a lot faster than array to search specific user. Because, when we get some key to find
   specific user such as name or id, we only need to find the certain hash linked elements which has the same hash number. In other words,
   it will be enough to find the specific user information among the users which has the same hash number.
   So, the hash implementaion will be much more faster when search the users.

3. I've implement the hash expansion. I implement hash expansion inside the RegisterCustomer function.
   <My Hash expansion algorithm>
   First, if the node is over 75% of the buckets, save the curArrSize at the int variable 'before'
   and then increase curArrSize by 1024 inside the DB.
   Then, dynamic allocates memory two times by calloc() to make the two hash table, name and id respectively.
   Copy all the elements from old hash table to new calloc() hash table array with new hash number. 
   -copy through all the node using only name hash table using 'before' variable.

4. I will use 1 day token.
