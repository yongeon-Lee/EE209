I get some help from my EE209 tutor Gundo Seo about Strcopy bugs.

Q. Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain.
A. It is not possible to verify the destination memory area is large enough by assertions because the error only occurs when the
   destination memory is not specified by the caller for example, the destination is specified by null pointer. So, it is no way to check by using assert function
   that the destination is large enough to copy.

I have used pointer notation for extra credit.
